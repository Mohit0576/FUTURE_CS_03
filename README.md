# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System – Internship Project

This internship project simulates real-world client work where secure file storage and transmission is critical. The goal was to design and implement a secure file sharing system that allows users to **upload** and **download** files safely — with an emphasis on **data confidentiality, secure transfer, and encryption**.

This was completed under the **Future Interns Cybersecurity Internship Program**, blending backend logic with frontend usability and encryption best practices.

## 🎯 Objective

- Develop a secure file-sharing system using Flask (Python)
- Implement **AES encryption** to protect file contents at rest
- Secure file transfer between users
- Provide an intuitive frontend for uploading and downloading files
- Simulate a real-world secure data storage service

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔒 AES-256 Encryption before saving uploaded files  
- 📁 Upload & download interface with clean UI  
- ✅ Simple, easy-to-follow user experience  
- 🚫 Prevents file overwriting and exposes no sensitive info  
- 📂 Secure storage of files in a structured folder

## 🧪 Tasks Performed

1. **Flask Web App Setup**  
   Initialized Flask app and routes for uploading, encrypting, and downloading files.

2. **Encryption Implementation**  
   Integrated `cryptography.fernet` for AES-256 encryption. All files are encrypted before being stored.

3. **Frontend Development**  
   Designed a clean upload/download interface using HTML and CSS.

4. **File Handling Logic**  
   Handled filenames securely. Prevented overwriting and ensured safe storage.

5. **Testing & Validation**  
   Simulated multiple upload/download cycles to validate security and 
- Upload page  
- Download confirmation  
- Folder showing encrypted file names

## 🚀 Outcome

This project helped me develop and apply practical skills in:

- Real-world web security practices  
- Encryption and secure storage techniques  
- Flask-based application development  
- Designing secure user-upload workflows  
- Merging security with frontend simplicity
